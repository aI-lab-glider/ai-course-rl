# Lab 04 - reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is a branch of AI that involves training an agent to make optimal decisions in an environment by learning from feedback in the form of rewards or punishments ðŸ§ ðŸ’ª. The agent explores the environment and takes actions to maximize its cumulative reward over time ðŸš€ðŸŽ². Reinforcement learning has practical applications in areas with delayed reward: e.g. robotics ðŸ¤–, game playing ðŸŽ®, scheduling and logistics. It is a powerful tool for developing intelligent systems that can learn and adapt to complex environments ðŸ¤–ðŸ“ˆ.
